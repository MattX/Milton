<h1>PRIVACY NOTICE</h1>

<p>Last updated 2020-05-01

<p>Thank you for demonstrating interest in the Milton Library Assistant. We
are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions
or concerns about our notice, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us
at matthieufelix@gmail.com.

<p>Please note that you must not use this website unless you have obtained consent to do so from the website owner.

<p>When you visit our website https://milton.terbium.io, and use our services, you trust us with your personal information.
We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy notice, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible
what information we collect, how we use it and what rights you have in relation to it. We hope you take some time
to read through it carefully, as it is important. If there are any terms in this privacy notice that you do not
agree with, please discontinue use of our Sites and our services.

<p>This privacy notice applies to all information collected through our website (such as https://terbium.io),
and/or any related services, sales, marketing or events (we refer to them collectively in this privacy notice
as the "Services").

<p>Please read this privacy notice carefully as it will help you make informed decisions about sharing your personal
information with us.

<h2>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>


<p>Information automatically collected

<p>In Short:   Some information — such as IP address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected
utomatically when you visit our Services.

<p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the Services. This information
does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and
usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences,
referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services and other
technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services,
and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.


<h2>2. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

<p>In Short:  We process your information for purposes based on legitimate business interests, the fulfillment of
our contract with you, compliance with our legal obligations, and/or your consent.

<p>We use the information we collect or receive to protect our Services. We may use your information as part of our
efforts to keep our Services safe and secure (for example, for fraud monitoring and prevention).


<h2>3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</h2>

<p>In Short:  We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to
protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.

<p>We may process or share data based on the following legal basis:

<p>Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information in
a specific purpose.

<p>Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate
business interests.

<p>Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information
to fulfill the terms of our contract.

<p>Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with
applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response
to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law
enforcement requirements).

<p>Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take
action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats
to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.


<h2>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

<p>In Short:  We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy
notice unless otherwise required by law.

<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than
90 days.

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
until deletion is possible.

<h2>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

<p>In Short:  We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security
measures.

<p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security
of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet
itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within
a secure environment.


<h2>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

<p>In Short:  We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

<p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services,
    you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent
    to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than
    18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
    delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age
    18, please contact us at matthieufelix@gmail.com.


<h2>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

<p>In Short:  You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.

<p>If you are resident in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or California, you may not use the Services,
    even if you have otherwise received authorization from the website owner. If we learn that you live in
    the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or California, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
    measures to promptly
    delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from residents of the European
    Economic Area, Switzerland, or California, please contact us at matthieufelix@gmail.com.

<p>If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
    information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.
    You can find their contact details here:
    http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.

<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are
    California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about
    categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes
    and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately
    preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit
    your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.

<p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Services,
    you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request
    removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email
    address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the
    data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or
    comprehensively removed from our systems.


<h2>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
    feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
    browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and
    implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
    signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
    If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about
    that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.


<h2>10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</h2>

<p>In Short:  Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.

<p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised”
date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes
to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly
sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how
we are protecting your information.


<h2>11. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS POLICY?</h2>

<p>If you have questions or comments about this policy, you may email us at matthieufelix@gmail.com

<h2>HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?</h2>

<p>Based on the laws of some countries, you may have the right to request access to the personal information we collect
from you, change that information, or delete it in some circumstances. To request to review, update, or delet
your personal information, please submit a request to matthieufelix@gmail.com. We will respond to your request
within 30 days.
